# ElectricalPriceCalc

A Python app that fetches electricity prices from [Nordpool](https://www.nordpoolgroup.com/) and calculates optimal charging times and energy-saving opportunities for your electric car.

---

## üì± Supported Platforms

This app is designed to work with [**AppDaemon**](https://github.com/AppDaemon/appdaemon) and [**Home Assistant**](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

- **Home Assistant** is a popular open-source home automation platform with extensive device integration. If you're not already using it, we recommend exploring [its website](https://www.home-assistant.io/).
- **AppDaemon** is a multi-threaded, sandboxed Python environment for writing automation apps, compatible with Home Assistant and MQTT-based systems.

---

## üîç How It Works

The app calculates:
- Optimal **electric vehicle charging times** based on future Nordpool prices (including taxes).
- When to **spend or save electricity** for cost efficiency.

> Originally part of a larger project called `ElectricalManagement`, this app was extracted into its own repository for easier integration into custom automation workflows.

## üì¶ Dependencies

Install the required packages using `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Configuration

1. **Clone the repository** into your [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) `apps` directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Pythm/ElectricalPriceCalc.git /path/to/appdaemon/apps/
   ```

2. **Configure the app** in your AppDaemon configuration file (`.yaml` or `.toml`):

```yaml
  electricalPriceCalc:
    module: electricalPriceCalc
    class: ElectricalPriceCalc
    pricearea: NO5  # Nordpool price area (e.g., NO5, DE1)
    currency: NOK   # Default: EUR
    country_code: NO  # Used to fetch location data
    VAT: 1.25       # Default: 25% VAT (1.25 = 1 + 0.25)
    daytax: 0.5986  # Daytime electricity tax (optional)
    nighttax: 0.4713 # Nighttime electricity tax (optional)
    power_support_above: 0.9125  # Threshold for power support (includes VAT) (optional)
    support_amount: 0.9          # Percentage of support (e.g., 90%) (optional)
```

---

## üìå Notes

- `country_code` will attempt to fetch latitude/longitude from your AppDaemon configuration if not defined.
- `VAT` is specified as a multiplier (e.g., 1.25 represents 25% VAT).
- Taxes and thresholds are optional and can be customized based on your region.

### üìå Example Use Case
